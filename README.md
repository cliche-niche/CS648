This repository contains assignment submissions made in the course CS648 (2022-23 II Sem.) at IIT-K in a team of two (Soham ["CrypthiccCrypto"](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto) Samaddar, and me). <br>

A brief description of each assignment is provided below:

+ Programming Assignments
  + [<u>PA1:</u>](./Programming%20Assignments/A1/) Compare run-time statistics of Randomized Quick Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort and draw inferences. <br> Awarded 50/50. <br> Team name: `Z9JyeeoHneeuYxbIzVR`
  + [<u>PA2:</u>](./Programming%20Assignments/A2/) Compare asymptotic behaviour and distribution of two different randomized client-server assignment protocols. <br> 5 marks deducted for not comparing rate of concentration around the mean. <br> Awarded 95/100. <br> Team name: `kQiAuZC8mLskFP47e39` 
+ Theoretical Assignments
  + [<u>TA1:</u>](./Theoretical%20Assignments/A1/) Analyse some algorithms using elementary probability theory. <br> 5 marks deducted in Q2 due to "Insufficient Reasoning", and 3 ("Algorithm is Incomplete") + 3 ("Time Complexity") marks deducted in Q3. <br> Awarded 149/160. <br> Team name: `wPyqRi7M8FrjCYZuK2p`
  + [<u>TA2:</u>](./Theoretical%20Assignments/A2/) Analyse some algorithms using concentration inequalities like Markov's Inequality, Chernoff Bound, etc. <br> Awarded 150/150. <br> Team name: `Ia1nXR7AArKBaEn7AoK`

### Team Name
The team name was chosen uniformly-randomly-independently for each assignment from the alphanumeric space provided by a keyboard.
